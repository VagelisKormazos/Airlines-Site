# Airlines-Site

##Implement the website of an airline.

###Main Goal

•Implement a website
•Create pages with HTML
•Create a Base with PostgreSQL's 
•Connect,write and save to Database with PHP

###
The first page will contain information that could be useful to someone who is interested in learning about the airline. For example, information about the destinations to which they can travel, travel guidelines, useful airport directions, flight schedules and anything else you think is necessary. If you deem it necessary you can place this information on different pages and link it to the main page or have it all on one page which when a link is selected (from a menu) will slide to the appropriate place. As long as the page has slid down far enough an arrow/button will appear which will lead up (top).
There will be a user/passenger input page. The page will store in a table in the database information such as the passenger's emal (which will also be his username), password/password, passenger's name, address, country, postcode, telephone number, credit card number and type (visa, mastercard, etc.). It will be possible to save, print and clear the form fields. The website details will be aligned. The password field will be able to accept 8 characters or more, a minimum of one number and a minimum of one uppercase character. The name, address fields will be able to enter only Latin characters. In the country field to allow him to choose any of the suggested ones. In the postal code field, allow him to enter only numbers and a maximum of 5 digits. In the e-mail field, to enter data in an appropriate format, e.g. onoma@unipi.gr, i.e. containing at least one character, the @ symbol. The telephone number field must be able to contain data in the form +30210xxxxxxxxx. The number of the
credit card number will be only numbers with a fixed number of 16 and the type of credit card can be selected either visa or mastercard or something else. In case of an error in any of the fields, a pop-up notification window will be displayed, the fields with the wrong data will be highlighted and message(s) indicating the error will be displayed on the web page. When the user selects the clear button all data entered will be deleted. When the user selects the print button the default print window will open to select the printer.
There will be a login page to the database. The passenger/user will be able to use their empal as username and password to log in. If the login is successful, the information in the previous paragraph will be displayed in a nice way.
All pages of the application will be linked together. The visitor will be able to switch from one to any other.
The information will be displayed using, at least, images, tables, lists, enriched text (using CSS rules), links to external and internal web pages and anything else that would make a tour/trip more desirable to the visitor.
Considering the plethora of devices that are used to visit a website, the site should display decently on ipad, and desktop (wide and narrow screen). It should, in other words, be responsive.
The site will contain all the elements of a functional website that may not be mentioned above, e.g. transition menus to the various web pages, and the information it contains should be as plausible as possible.
